# **App Name**: AI Gateway Resilient

## Core Features:

- API Gateway: Act as a reverse proxy and load balancer for AI model APIs, improving system resilience.
- Smart Key Management: Monitor health and automatically rotate keys to prevent service disruptions.
- Conversation Cache: Use Redis caching for conversation history with a 24-hour TTL.
- Multi-Provider Support: Integrate with multiple AI providers such as Together.ai and OpenAI. This feature is implemented as a tool by the gateway. The gateway decides, based on the state of various APIs at that given moment, to decide which vendor it will send a given request to.
- Streaming Support: Supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates from AI models.
- Web Interface: Provides an interface to view request status and other important details. Serve a web interface supporting client-side streaming capabilities and static file serving.
- Automated Retries: Implement automatic retries and exponential backoff for failed API requests.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and stability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), near white, to ensure a clean and accessible interface.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#BA68C8) to create contrast and guide user attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif, for a modern and neutral look.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent different gateway functionalities and statuses.
- Clean and minimalist design with a focus on data visualization of gateway performance.
- Subtle animations for loading states and key rotation processes.
